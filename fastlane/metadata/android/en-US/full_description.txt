<i>Dawn</i> puts the focus on user-generated content. The UI takes a back-seat so that you can enjoy photos posted by Everything’s lovely users in their full glory. It is driven by gestures. Unlike taps, gestures enable faster navigation, are easier to build muscle memories for (because of their larger surface areas) and most important of all — they are downright enjoyable.

While going all-in on gestures, <i>Dawn</i> still ensures that they’re consistent. Vertical gestures are used for navigation. Horizontal gestures are used for actions like voting or scrolling through an Imgur album.

Further features include:

* Drag to dismiss screens
* Inline replies
* Live Markdown
* Undo
* GIFs
* Rich media notifications
